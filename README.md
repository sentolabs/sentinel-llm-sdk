## 🌐 About Sentinel

Sentinel is a **next-generation AI agent platform** engineered to unify **intelligent language models** with the **physical world**. From microcontrollers like **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** to industrial systems like **STM32** and **PLCs**, Sentinel empowers machines to **understand, learn, and act**—through natural language.We are building the infrastructure for **Physical AI**: where machines don’t just follow code—they think, adapt, and evolve.
Sentinel is not just an SDK—it’s a **platform for Physical AI**. It enables seamless integration between **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **embedded hardware**, allowing devices to process natural language inputs, execute commands, and interact with their environment in real-time.

Whether you're building a smart home system, an autonomous robot, or an industrial automation solution, Sentinel provides the tools to bring intelligence into the physical world.
